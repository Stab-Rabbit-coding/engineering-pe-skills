# Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering

Ship hydrostatics, intact stability, and resistance/powering analysis aligned to
the NCEES PE Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering examination, with every
numeric criterion traceable to a cited authority.

## Mandatory notice — emit this every time

**Before any analysis, in every response where this skill contributes, emit the
following notice verbatim.** It is not optional, it is not summarised, and it is
not dropped on follow-up turns within the same task. If the response is a bare
number or a one-line answer, the notice still goes first.

> ⚠️ **ENGINEERING REVIEW REQUIRED — this output is not a substitute for a
> qualified engineer.** Every result, calculation, and recommendation produced
> with this skill **must be independently reviewed and accepted by a properly
> qualified individual** — a licensed Professional Engineer or an equivalently
> qualified authority for the jurisdiction and discipline — **before it is
> applied to any system carrying risk to life or safety.** This skill informs
> engineering judgment; it does not replace it. It is reference material
> provided AS-IS (see LICENSE §5), is not an engineering service, and does not
> constitute a sealed, certified, or reviewed work product for any specific
> project.

Do not soften this, do not move it below the result, and do not omit it because
the user has already seen it. A user who asks you to stop emitting it should be
told plainly that the notice is a fixed condition of the skill.

## Examination standing

Aligned to **PE Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering** [REF-NCEES-008] — 85
questions across a 9.5-hour appointment. Unlike PE Mechanical, the NCEES exam
landing page does not publish a named module breakdown; the full exam
specification PDF has not yet been obtained and catalogued for this repository
(`TODO.md` §0.5). Do not present a module structure for this exam as
NCEES-published fact.

The principal discipline society is **SNAME** [REF-SOC-002], whose stated
mission is "advancing the art, science, and practice of naval architecture and
marine engineering." SNAME operates a member PE Review Course and publishes
*Principles of Naval Architecture* (PNA) [REF-SNAME-001], the field's standard
reference text — cited here generally for method scope, not by specific page or
edition, per the caution recorded against REF-SNAME-001 in `REFERENCES.md`.

Two numeric method sets in this skill are verified against primary sources, not
against PNA:

* Intact stability criteria — the **IMO 2008 IS Code** [REF-IMO-001], read
  directly from the publisher's 2020 Edition text.
* Resistance-coefficient decomposition and the 1957 ITTC model-ship correlation
  line — **ITTC Recommended Procedure 7.5-02-02-01** [REF-ITTC-001], read
  directly.

## Non-negotiable practice rules

1. **Units are imperial-primary with metric in parentheses** — `ft (m)` length,
   `lbm (kg)` or long tons `(t)` for displacement, `lbf (N)` force,
   `kt (m/s)` speed. Marine practice runs metric internally (the IMO Code and
   ITTC procedures are both SI); convert explicitly and state the conversion
   rather than silently mixing systems.
2. **A stability or resistance result without its loading condition is
   meaningless.** State displacement, KG (or LCG/VCG), and trim for every GZ
   curve, GM, or resistance figure — these are not properties of the hull alone.
3. **Free surface effect is not optional.** Any slack tank reduces effective GM;
   apply the free-surface correction before comparing GM against a criterion
   [REF-IMO-001 §2.1.2].
4. **State which stability criterion governs** — the general righting-lever
   criteria (§2.2) and the weather criterion (§2.3) are both mandatory and
   independent; passing one does not imply passing the other.
5. **Model and full-scale resistance do not scale on the same law.** Froude
   scaling governs wave-making (geometrically similar models at matched
   $Fr$); Reynolds scaling governs viscous friction. A single model test cannot
   match both simultaneously — this is exactly why the ITTC-57 correlation line
   exists, to extrapolate frictional resistance separately from the
   Froude-scaled wave-making component [REF-ITTC-001].
6. **Name the failure mode** for any structural or freeboard check handed off
   elsewhere — this skill does not itself cover hull-girder longitudinal
   strength or scantlings; flag that as out of scope and refer to a classed
   structural analysis.

## Method selection

| Problem | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Buoyancy, displacement, GM, GZ curve, IMO stability criteria, trim, freeboard | `references/hydrostatics-and-stability.md` |
| Hull resistance, Froude/Reynolds scaling, ITTC-57 line, propulsion coefficients, powering | `references/resistance-and-propulsion.md` |

## Core workflow

### Hydrostatics and stability

1. **Fix the loading condition.** Displacement $\Delta$, LCG, VCG (KG), and any
   free-surface tanks. Nothing downstream means anything without this.
2. **Compute the hydrostatic properties** for that draft — KB, BM, $I_T/\nabla$
   — and the resulting GM.
3. **Build or read the GZ curve** (from hull GZ/KN cross-curves) across the
   heel range needed by the governing criterion.
4. **Check every applicable IMO general criterion independently**, then the
   weather criterion — do not stop at the first one satisfied.
5. **State margin against each criterion**, not just pass/fail.

### Resistance and powering

1. **Establish the speed range and length** to get $Fr$ and $Re$ — state which
   regime (displacement vs planing/high-speed) applies; this skill's method set
   is the conventional-displacement procedure [REF-ITTC-001].
2. **Decompose resistance**: frictional (ITTC-57 line, form-factor corrected)
   plus wave-making (from model test or a cited empirical series) plus
   appendage and air resistance.
3. **Convert to effective power** $P_E = R_T V$.
4. **Apply propulsion coefficients** — wake fraction, thrust deduction, hull
   efficiency, relative rotative efficiency, open-water propeller efficiency —
   to reach delivered and shaft power.
5. **State the margin** applied for sea state, hull fouling, and design service
   speed versus trial speed, and where that margin came from.

## Reporting a result

* **Result** in `metric (imperial)` — this discipline's primary sources are SI;
  invert the usual ordering and say so, rather than silently reporting only one
  system
* **Loading condition** — displacement, KG/VCG, trim, free-surface status
* **Criterion or method** applied, with its REF-ID
* **Margin**, not just pass/fail
* **Scaling law** used for any model-to-full-scale extrapolation, and its
  validity range
* Where the result feeds hull structure, propulsion machinery selection, or a
  classification-society submittal, say explicitly that those are out of scope
  here and name the discipline that owns them
