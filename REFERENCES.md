  Unintentional Radiators) — Federal Communications Commission,
  Code of Federal Regulations
* **URL:** <https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-15>

  repository's network-egress policy and could not be fetched directly.
  Title, subpart structure (Subpart B — Unintentional Radiators), Class A
  (industrial) / Class B (residential) classification, and the
  certification-or-Supplier's-Declaration-of-Conformity authorization
  framework corroborated across independent secondary listings on
  2026-09-18: eCFR's own indexed subpart page text, govinfo.gov (the
  official Federal Register/CFR publisher), and the FCC's own Office of
  Engineering and Technology equipment-authorization page. **No specific
  numeric emissions limit table value is asserted anywhere in this
  repository** — confirm the current rule text directly before relying on
  a limit.
* **Applied:** US regulatory framework for unlicensed intentional,
  unintentional, and incidental radiators — the source of the numeric
  emissions limits that IEEE/ANSI C63.4 [REF-IEEE-002] specifies how to
  measure.

### REF-IPC-001 — IPC-2221, Generic Standard on Printed Board Design

* **Title:** *IPC-2221 — Generic Standard on Printed Board Design*
  (current revision C) — IPC (Association Connecting Electronics
  Industries)
* **URL:** <https://shop.ipc.org/ipc-2221/ipc-2221-standard-only/Revision-c/english>

  repository's network-egress policy and could not be fetched directly.
  Designation and scope (generic requirements for printed-board design —
  electrical, mechanical, thermal, environmental, and reliability —
  foundation standard for the IPC-2220 series) corroborated across
  independent secondary listings on 2026-09-18: IPC's own shop listing
  text, and electronics.org's mirrored table-of-contents pages for prior
  revisions. **No specific trace-width, spacing, or current-capacity table
  value is asserted anywhere in this repository** — confirm the current
  edition directly before relying on a specific number.
* **Applied:** Framework authority for board-level conductor spacing and
  current-carrying-capacity design rules. IPC is a distinct SDO from this
  skill's principal sponsoring society (IEEE); cited because no IEEE
  standard covers this specific scope.

  exception conditions and their default handling." Cited for the existence
  of binary and decimal formats, the exception classes, and the general
  structure of a binary interchange format. **The standard's body text

## Removed / Superseded Citations

* **2026-09-19 — REF-ID collision corrected.** `REF-IEEE-002` had been
  assigned twice: to IEEE/ANSI C63.4 (§3, `electronics-engineering`) and to
  IEEE 754-2019 (§4, `computer-engineering`). IEEE 754-2019 is now
  `REF-IEEE-006`; `REF-IEEE-002` remains C63.4. Both skill files that cited
  754 were updated in the same commit. No content changed.

**Corrected 2026-08-29 — factor of safety in 14 CFR Part 23.** An earlier draft
of `references/loads-and-factors.md` marked the 1.5 airframe factor of safety
`REQUIRES VERIFICATION`, on the reasoning that the 2017 Part 23 restructure
moved
numeric criteria into consensus standards. Reading the current rule text from
the
eCFR API disproved that for the factor of safety specifically: **§23.2230(b)
states the 1.5 factor explicitly and it is current.** The caution was correct
for
the *manoeuvring load factors* (+3.8 / −1.52), which are genuinely absent from
the
current rule. Both are now cited accurately under REF-FAA-002.
