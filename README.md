# Engineering PE Skills

Agent Skills for licensed-discipline engineering practice, with authoritative
citations and explicit calculation methods.

Twelve skills covering the engineering disciplines needed for real hardware
design.
Each is aligned — where an alignment honestly exists — to an
[NCEES PE discipline](https://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/), and each cites its
discipline's professional society and standards-developing organization.

## Qualified review is required -  THESE SKILLS ARE STILL WORKS IN PROGRESS.  NONE should be considered RELEASED until reviewed and approved by an Engineer Licensed and qualified in the specific discipline.

> ⚠️ **ENGINEERING REVIEW REQUIRED — output from these skills is not a substitute
> for a qualified engineer.** Every result, calculation, and recommendation
> produced with any skill in this repository **must be independently reviewed and
> accepted by a properly qualified individual** — a licensed Professional Engineer
> or an equivalently qualified authority for the jurisdiction and discipline —
> **before it is applied to any system carrying risk to life or safety.** These
> skills inform engineering judgment; they do not replace it. They are
> reference material provided AS-IS (see LICENSE §5), are not an engineering
> service, and do not constitute a sealed, certified, or reviewed work product
> for any specific project.

Every skill instructs the agent to emit this notice at the start of every
response it contributes to. That instruction is a fixed condition of the
skills, not a configurable option — but it is an instruction to an LLM, not a
mechanism. A host with a "no preambles" system prompt or a summarising harness
can drop it; confirm your agent honours it, and treat any output where the
notice is missing as unreviewed.

## Design principles

* **No fabricated references.** Every standard, section, and figure is catalogued
  in [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md) with a validated URL and a verification
  status. Anything unconfirmed is marked `REQUIRES VERIFICATION` and tracked in
  [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) §0 — it is never asserted as fact.
* **Imperial-primary units with metric in parentheses**, and `lbm`/`lbf`
  distinguished throughout. Airspeed in knots.
* **Methods carry their validity envelope.** A skill that gives you an equation
  also tells you where it stops being true.
* **Assumptions are labelled on every run**, so an assumed value never hardens
  into a fact by repetition.
* **Real builds.** These skills assume the output gets fabricated, not filed —
  which is exactly why the review notice above is mandatory and unconditional.

## Disciplines

| Skill | NCEES PE alignment | Society / SDO |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aeronautical-engineering` | **None — no PE exam exists** | AIAA; FAA & NASA & ASTM F38 as authority |
| `mechanical-engineering` | Mechanical (HVAC&R; Machine Design & Materials; Thermal & Fluid Systems) | ASME |
| `statics-and-dynamics` | **FE-level**, not a PE discipline | — (foundational; NCEES FE) |
| `thermodynamics` | **FE-level**, not a PE discipline | — (foundational; NCEES FE) |
| `control-systems-engineering` | Control Systems | ISA |
| `chemical-engineering` | Chemical | AIChE / CCPS |
| `electrical-engineering` | Electrical and Computer: Power | IEEE |
| `electronics-engineering` | Electrical and Computer: Electronics, Controls, and Communications | IEEE |
| `computer-engineering` | Electrical and Computer: Computer Engineering | IEEE |
| `naval-architecture-marine` | Naval Architecture and Marine | SNAME |
| `fire-protection-engineering` | Fire Protection | SFPE / NFPA |
| `materials-and-additive-manufacturing` | Metallurgical and Materials (partial) | ASTM / ASM |

### Two honest exceptions

**Aeronautical engineering has no NCEES PE examination.** The PE catalog contains
23 disciplines and aeronautical is not among them. Engineers needing licensure in
this field typically sit PE Mechanical. This repository does not claim an
alignment that does not exist; the aeronautical skill is aligned to FAA
regulation, NASA technical standards, and ASTM F38 instead.

**Statics and dynamics, and thermodynamics/heat transfer/fluid mechanics, are
FE-level subject matter**, appearing in the Fundamentals of Engineering exam
and inside several PE specifications — not PE disciplines of their own. Both
are provided as foundational skills the others build on.

## Installation

> **Pre-release drafts.** Eight of the nine skills here are unreviewed 0.x
> drafts — see [Status](#status); only `control-systems-engineering` has had
> its technical content accepted by a licensed engineer (`TODO.md` §4.1,
> `REVIEW_LOG.md`). Each `SKILL.md` states its own state in
> `metadata.review_status`. Install them knowing that.

## Status

Under active development. See [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for the work breakdown
structure and current completion state.

| Skill | State |
| --- | --- |
| `aeronautical-engineering` | Draft — SKILL.md + 4 reference files |
| `mechanical-engineering` | Draft — SKILL.md + 3 reference files |
| `statics-and-dynamics` | Draft — SKILL.md + 3 reference files |
| `control-systems-engineering` | **Reviewed** — PE Control Systems, 2026-09-19 (`REVIEW_LOG.md`) |
| `naval-architecture-marine` | Draft — SKILL.md + 2 reference files |
| `thermodynamics` | Draft — SKILL.md + 3 reference files |
| `electrical-engineering` | Draft — SKILL.md + 3 reference files |
| `electronics-engineering` | Draft — SKILL.md + 2 reference files |
| `computer-engineering` | Draft — SKILL.md + 4 reference files |
| remaining three | Not started |

Eight of the nine drafts are pending licensed PE review (`TODO.md` §4.1)
before publication; `control-systems-engineering` has received it.

agent audit trail. Engineer of record: Stephen Griffing, PE

skill's technical content (`TODO.md` §4.1) is a gate for the 1.0 release;
as of 2026-09-19 only `control-systems-engineering` has received it.

### Why no-derivatives

Each skill's safety case rests on its reviewed, cited content. Where a
licensed engineer has put their licence on a skill (`REVIEW_LOG.md`), the
wording *is* the reviewed work: a modified skill is no longer that work, but
would still emit the same notices — carrying the reviewer's name and this
repository's verification claims on content nobody has checked. The licence
therefore permits use and unmodified redistribution but not sharing of
modified versions.

### Reviewed skills carry a second notice

A skill whose `metadata.review_status` begins `REVIEWED` emits, every turn
after the general notice, a **licensed-engineer attestation** in the
reviewer's name (canonical text in `AGENTS.md`). It states that the content
was verified against the standards of practice, that its wording is fixed,
that the reviewer's acceptance covers the skill's content only and carries no
liability for work done with it, and that such work still needs its own
qualified-engineer sign-off. Currently: `control-systems-engineering`.

### Licence scope — what CC BY-ND 4.0 does and does not do

* **You may** copy, redistribute, and install these skills unmodified, and
  adapt them for your own private use (LICENSE §2(a)(1)).
* **You may not** publicly distribute a modified version (LICENSE §2(a)(1)(b),
  §3(a)(1)). Send corrections upstream instead — see
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
* **A locally modified copy is no longer the reviewed artefact.** It inherits
  none of this repository's citation-verification or engineer-review claims.
  If the mandatory notice is missing from a copy, treat its output as
  unreviewed.
* **Your own work is yours.** Analyses, calculations, reports, and designs
  you produce *using* these skills are not Licensed Material or Adapted
  Material under this licence; share them freely, subject to the
  qualified-review requirement above. Reproducing the review notice in such
  output is expressly permitted without further attribution.
* **The licence does not enforce the review requirement.** CC BY-ND governs
  copying; it neither substitutes for nor compels the qualified engineering
  review described above, which applies to any use, modified or not.
* **Not retroactive.** Revisions through commit `5300e0e` were published under
  the MIT License and that grant is not withdrawn for copies already obtained;
  CC BY-ND 4.0 applies from commit `a113589` (2026-09-19) onward.
